### Hi, I’m Margaux 👋🏼

I have 6+ experiences working in the Fashion industry 👠, in a very demanding and international environment. Thanks to my previous experiences, I master product management 🗒, business analytics 📊 and problem solving ✅.

Moved by an explorer and creative mind plus a strong interest for new technologies, I have decided to embrace a new challenge and learn coding @LeWagon 🚀. Today I am a Ruby on Rails Developer 👩🏼‍💻 and keep working on developing my technical skills 🎓.

I am currently looking for new opportunities in tech 💼, if you are interested in my hybrid profile, I would be thrilled to discuss with you ✨.
