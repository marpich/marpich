### Hi, I’m Margaux 👋🏼

I have 6+ experiences working in the Fashion industry 👠, in a very demanding and international environment. Thanks to my previous experiences, I master product management 🗒, business analytics 📊 and problem solving ✅.

Today I am a Ruby on Rails Developer 👩🏼‍💻 and keep working on developing my technical skills 🎓.
